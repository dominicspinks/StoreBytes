# Planning

## Purpose

Store files in the cloud and access them from anywhere. This is to replace the use of AWS S3 in my projects.

	-	Create 'buckets' to store files
	-   Upload files to buckets
	-   Download files from buckets
	-   Delete files from buckets
	-   Delete buckets
-	Management
	-	Sign up
	-	Sign in
	-	Sign out
	-	Change password
	-	Reset password

	-	List files in a bucket
	-	Create API Key
	-	Delete API Key
-	Restrictions
	-	File size limits
